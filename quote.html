                <blockquote>The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.</blockquote>

                <blockquote>I am not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happens.</blockquote>

            <div class="quote" id="quote3">
                <blockquote>Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.</blockquote>
                <i>— Marcus Aurelius</i>
