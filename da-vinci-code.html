            <h2>The Da Vinci Code review</h2>
            <p>Review and summary on a novel, titled “The Da Vinci Code”, written by the thriller and mystery novelist Dan Brown. The book follows Robert Langdon, the protagonist of multiple novels, who is a famous symbologist, and his sidekick, Sophie Neveu, as they embark on a journey while searching for the Holy Grail. The historical objects and events discussed in the book are completely accurate, Dan Brown did thorough research before writing.</p>
            <p>The novel really excels at keeping up the attention of the reader’s attention, as the protagonists are rushing from city to city all the time. The characters are very diverse in ethnicity, physical appearance, and intentions. The environments are real, they are famous locations most of the time, such as the Westminster Abbey, or the Louvre. As the title implies, the novel mainly revolves around Da Vinci’s legacy and paintings. The author uses these sources surprisingly well to build up the conspiracy theories in the novel, which are actually based on real theories and facts. There are a lot of very surprising turns in the book, and spoilers hurt even more for the story. The novel has just so many hidden codes, riddles, and references that you feel an irresistible urge to keep up with the protagonists decoding it, and you partake in the emotional and mental rollercoaster they experience while making new discoveries.</p>
            <p>Here's a bit of backstory on the characters and organizations! Robert Langdon is a somewhat famous symbologist from Harvard University. Sophie Neveu is a cryptographer, and the estranged granddaughter of Jacques Sauniére, the curator of the Louvre. Silas is a member of a Catholic organization, the Opus Dei, who were aimed to be detached from the Vatican church. Aringarosa, the bishop of Opus Dei made a pact with a mysterious man called the “Teacher”, who promised to help them find the Holy Grail by acquiring an object named the keystone. Leigh Teabing is a rich English knight living in the French Château Villette. He is an old friend of Robert Langdon, and he’s obsessed with finding the Holy Grail. The Priory is Sion is a cult pledged to protect the keystone and the secret of the Holy Grail. Jacques Sauniére is a member of this cult.</p>
            <p class="alert alert-danger">HEAVY spoilers from now on, they will hurt your reading experience, more than they would in other books!</p>
            <p>This paragraph will summarize the plot, but be aware of the spoilers, they are more dangerous than in other books! Robert Langdon is in Paris after he gave a presentation, and late in the night he gets a call from his hotel’s reception that he has a visitor. It turns out to be a French cop as he knocks on the door, and asks him to help the police’s work. He hands Langdon a photograph, which shows Jacques Sauniére, the curator of the Louvre dead. Jacques and Langdon didn’t know each other personally before, but they had a meeting arrangement that night. As Langdon gets to the Louvre, he meets police officer Bezu Fache, who shows him the body. Jacques’ body lies on the floor naked, arranged into a weird pose, and he has a message left on the floor besides him. The message contains the sentence “find Robert Langdon”, which gets mistaken by Fache, he thinks it means that Robert is the suspected killer. A bit later, Sophie Neveu arrives to aid the investigation, and he informs Langdon about the danger that he is suspected. They fake Langdon’s escape from the Louvre, and they decode the message, which leads them to a key, hidden behind a painting. They escape, and end up in a Swiss bank, which has a slot that is assigned to the key they found. They ask for the safe, they open it, and find an object, named “cryptex” in it. It’s a device which needs a five-letter passcode to open, but destructs its content if someone attempts to open it forcefully. The police gets a tip on their location in the bank, but they escape once again with the help of the director. They travel to Château Villette, the castle of Leigh Teabing. They hope for safety and help there, as Langdon is now wanted by the police. They are followed by Silas, an albino member of Opus Dei. He was the one that killed Jacques, and he is on the quest of finding the “keystone”, which contains the location of the Grail, and what turns out to be the cryptex. Leigh welcomes the guests, and discusses with them on the theme of the Holy Grail, but Langdon and Neveu decide to not share the secret of the cryptex, so they attempt to look like people who just have news on the research of the Holy Grail. Teabing finds out that Langdon is wanted by the police, and he decides to help them after they tell him everything. Silas attacks the group, but they manage to overwhelm him, then they escape from the police once again. They head to a local airport where Leigh has a reserved hangar, and a personal aircraft, and they pay off the pilot to make an illegal takeoff, and transport them to the United Kingdom. Onboard, they succeed in opening the cryptex, only to find a smaller one inside. Fache, the police officer, contacts the English authorities, and they manage to get to the airport before the group of protagonists. The cops search the plane, but only find Teabing and his French butler, Rémy. As it turns out, Langdon, Sophie, and the tied up Silas were dropped off in the reserved hangar, before the pilot turned the craft, and they rushed to Leigh’s limousine right before the police arrived there. Leigh, as the authorities must admit he’s clear, gets into the limousine with Rémy, and heads to town with the others. Earlier they found a riddle besides the smaller cryptex, and they solved its first half, which leads to a temple in London. They arrive, head inside, and while they search the local tombs, Rémy frees Silas, betraying the others. As he admits, he is a helper of The Teacher, and he convinces Silas to help him, as the albino follows The Teacher’s orders too. The duo confronts the protagonists, they end up abducting Leigh, and stealing the cryptex. Silas heads to a local Opus Dei shelter, and Rémy meets up with The Teacher in the St. James park. The Teacher poisons Rémy, as he knows too much, and takes a trip to Isaac Newton’s tomb inside the Westminster Abbey, because he believes that it hides the solution to the cryptex’s riddle. Langdon and Sophie also come to the conclusion that they are searching in the wrong temple, and they change their destination to the Abbey. They arrive at Newton’s tomb, and find a message left on it by The Teacher, which asks them to meet with him behind the Abbey, as he has Leigh. The two head the way The Teacher told them, but it turns out that the specified hall doesn’t have an exit. It is revealed that Leigh is in fact The Teacher, and he aims at the duo with a handgun. After a lot of discussion he threatens to kill Sophie, and Langdon threatens to destroy the cryptex in response. A tense moment makes him hurl the object into the air, and Leigh jumps on his side to catch it, dropping his gun. The police arrives, and the cryptex turns out to be solved by Langdon. Bezu Fache apologises to Robert, as they take Teabing away. Langdon and Sophie travel to the location that was hidden inside the cryptex, where they find a small temple. The temple’s caretakers turn out to be Sophie’s grandmother (Jacques’ wife) and brother, who were thought to have died in an accident with Sophie’s parents when she was small. Mrs. Sauniére reveals that the Grail is not in the church, but Langdon figures out that it is actually in the Louvre, where the whole journey started a day earlier.</p>
