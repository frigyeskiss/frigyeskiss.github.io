            <h2>The best monospace fonts for coding</h2>
            <p>For years, I've been pursuing the perfect monospace font for coding. As I started to use better, and better fonts, I realized that they can be used for much more than just coding. If you want to achieve a "no-design" design, you should use monospace fonts. If you want to create a minimalistic feel, or some '90s website, you should also check out some monospace fonts.</p>
            <p>Here is my list of the best monospace fonts, that are free-to-use, and look cool in both coding, and design.</p>
            <b>1. Roboto Mono</b>
            <p>The Roboto Mono evolved into monospace from the neo-grotesque sans-serif font: Roboto. I currently use this font in Visual Studio Code, and this website is also featuring it. A lot of people don't like it, but I fell in love with it, as soon as I saw it. It's also avaliable on <a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono">Google Fonts</a>, so there is no reason why you shouldn't try it out!</p>
            <b>2. Consolas/Inconsolata</b>
            <p>These fonts are pretty much the same. The difference is that Inconsolata is also avaliable on <a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata">Google Fonts</a>, while Consolas is a proprietary font. Consolas has been around for a long time, and it is one of the best-looking monospace fonts of all time.</p>
            <b>3. Source Code Pro</b>
            <p>If you like wider glyphs for your font, you should definitely check out this one. It's also on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro">Google Fonts</a>, so anyone can use it. Before I started using Roboto Mono, this was my favorite one. (My friend, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Daaniiieel">Daniel</a> is using it rn, so one more reason to check it out!)</p>
            <b>4. Courier/Courier New</b>
            <p>You want an original? Courier is for you! It's been around since the 1990s, and before the serif fonts, it was the most widely used font in the world. In fact it was originally designed for typewriters by IBM. IBM did not trademark the name Courier, so the typeface design and its name are now public-domain, but sadly it isn't avaliable on Google Fonts, so you'll have to find an other source. (There is a great chance that it came pre-installed on your OS!)</p>
            <b>5. Fira Code</b>
            <p>I did not choose this font because of its look, but because of its capabilities. The designer of the font pointed out the importancy of an easily-readable code.</p>
            <blockquote>Programmers use a lot of symbols, often encoded with several characters. For the human brain, sequences like ->, <= or := are single logical tokens, even if they take two or three characters on the screen. Your eye spends a non-zero amount of energy to scan, parse and join multiple characters into a single logical one. Ideally, all programming languages should be designed with full-fledged Unicode symbols for operators, but thatâ€™s not the case yet. Fira Code is an extension of the Fira Mono font containing a set of ligatures for common programming multi-character combinations. This is just a font rendering feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible. This helps to read and understand code faster. For some frequent sequences like .. or //, ligatures allow us to correct spacing.</blockquote>

            <p>So these fonts are the best in my opinion. If I find another I really like, I'll update the list asap. Thanks for reading!</p>
