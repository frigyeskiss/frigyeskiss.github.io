            <h2>The best monospace fonts for coding</h2>
            <p>For years, I've been pursuing the perfect monospace font for coding. As I started to use better, and better fonts, I realized that they can be used for much more than just coding. If you want to achieve a "no-design" design, you should use monospace fonts. If you want to create a minimalistic feel, or some '90s website, you should also check out some monospace fonts.</p>
            <p>Here is my list of the best monospace fonts, that are free-to-use, and look cool in both coding, and design.</p>
            <b>1. Roboto Mono</b>
            <p>The Roboto Mono evolved into monospace from the neo-grotesque sans-serif font: Roboto. I currently use this font in Visual Studio Code, and this website is also featuring it. A lot of people don't like it, but I fell in love with it, as soon as I saw it. It's also avaliable on <a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono">Google Fonts</a>, so there is no reason why you shouldn't try it out!</p>
            <b>2. Consolas/Inconsolata</b>
            <p>These fonts are pretty much the same. The difference is that Inconsolata is also avaliable on <a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata">Google Fonts</a>, while Consolas is a proprietary font. Consolas has been around for a long time, and it is one of the best-looking monospace fonts of all time.</p>
            <b>3. Source Code Pro</b>
            <p>If you like wider glyphs for your font, you should definitely check out this one. It's also on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro">Google Fonts</a>, so anyone can use it. Before I started using Roboto Mono, this was my favorite one. (My friend, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Daaniiieel">Daniel</a> is using it rn, so one more reason to check it out!)</p>
            <b>4. Courier/Courier New</b>
            <p>You want an original? Courier is for you! It's been around since the 1990s, and before the serif fonts, it was the most widely used font in the world. In fact it was originally designed for typewriters by IBM. IBM did not trademark the name Courier, so the typeface design and its name are now public-domain, but sadly it isn't avaliable on Google Fonts, so you'll have to find an other source. (There is a great chance that it came pre-installed on your OS!)</p>
            <b>5. Iosevka</b>
            <p>As the <a target="_blank" href="https://typeof.net/Iosevka/specimen">website</a> says, "Iosevka is an open-source, sans-serif + slab-serif, monospace + quasiâ€‘proportional typeface family, designed for writing code, using in terminals, and preparing technical documents." And this is a hundred percent true. It has much more variants than other fonts, and if you don't like the "t" glyph in the current version, or you cannot distinguish two letters, you can always switch to an other variant.</p>
            <b>6. Mplus</b>
            <p><a href="https://mplus-fonts.osdn.jp/about-en.html">Mplus</a> is another great free font, which is easy-to-read, and has multiple variants in latin proportional fonts, and even two kana glyph variations in japanese fonts. I definitely use kana glyphs every day.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>So these fonts are the best in my opinion. If I find another I really like, I'll update the list asap. Thanks for reading!</p>
