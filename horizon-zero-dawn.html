            <h2>Horizon Zero Dawn review</h2>
            <p>Review and summary on a story-driven computer game titled "Horizon: Zero Dawn", developed by the studio "Guerrilla Games", and published by Sony in 2017 for the PS4 Pro, later in 2020 for Windows 10. The narrative focuses on Aloy, the female protagonist who lives in the 31st century in a post-apocalyptic world, where humanity has fallen back into tribal culture, and practices a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.</p>
            <p>The game sticks to the classical RPG elements seen in other story-driven games, mainly to the ones that are published by Ubisoft. The well-known quest system is easy to understand, it operates with clear tasks, and gives enough crutches to enable newer players to enjoy the game just as experienced players would. The combat system is well-developed, extremely visual, and feels very rewarding. Taking down hostiles can be complicated, and depends on one's fine motor skills, as it is based on a rare "weak point" system. The graphics are stunning even on a weaker GTX card, thanks to the next-gen engine "Decima", developed by Guerrilla Games and Kojima Productions. The textures and shaders feel extremely crisp, but the poor anti-aliasing can often worsen the experience, especially on lower resolutions, and while the monitor panel is observed close-by.</p>
            <p>The story is absolutely worth the playthrough, you get approximately 25 hours on content, just by the main line, but further sidelines can be completed to lengthen the experience. The setting is a post-apocalyptic Earth, where nature has taken back its land, and humanity lives in tribal societies, surviving by hunting with spears and bows, and gathering food. They live among mechanical creatures, resembling various animal species, and they have no clue where they are produced, or why are they here. They have forgotten of the old civilization.</p>
