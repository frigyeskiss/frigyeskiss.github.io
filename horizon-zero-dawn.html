            <h2>Horizon Zero Dawn review</h2>
            <p>Review and summary on a story-driven computer game titled "Horizon: Zero Dawn", developed by the studio "Guerrilla Games", and published by Sony in 2017 for the PS4 Pro, later in 2020 for Windows 10. The narrative focuses on Aloy, the female protagonist who lives in the 31st century in a post-apocalyptic world, where humanity has fallen back into tribal culture, and practices a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.</p>
            <p>The game sticks to the classical RPG elements seen in other story-driven games, mainly to the ones that are published by Ubisoft. The well-known quest system is easy to understand, it operates with clear tasks, and gives enough crutches to enable newer players to enjoy the game just as experienced players would. The combat system is well-developed, extremely visual, and feels very rewarding. Taking down hostiles can be complicated, and depends on one's fine motor skills, as it is based on a rare "weak point" system. The graphics are stunning even on a weaker GTX card, thanks to the next-gen engine "Decima", developed by Guerrilla Games and Kojima Productions. The textures and shaders feel extremely crisp, but the poor anti-aliasing can often worsen the experience, especially on lower resolutions, and while the monitor panel is observed close-by.</p>
            <p>The story is absolutely worth the playthrough, you get approximately 25 hours on content, just by the main line, but further sidelines can be completed to lengthen the experience. The setting is a post-apocalyptic Earth, where nature has taken back its land, and humanity lives in tribal societies, surviving by hunting with spears and bows, and gathering food. They live among mechanical creatures, resembling various animal species, and they have no clue where they are produced, or why are they here. They have forgotten of the old civilization. One of the existing tribes, the Nora worship an ancient metal door, and an AI with a synthetic voice as their goddess, and one day they find a newborn baby on the the to the door. She gets cast out of the tribe, as she is motherless, and another outcast, Rost becomes her foster father. He names the baby Aloy, and teaches her the ways of survival in the wilds, and helps her prepare to win the Proving, which is a ritual of the Nora, it marks the start of adulthood for the participants, and if one finishing participant is an outcast, they can become part of the tribe once again. The winner of the Proving is granted a request, which will be carried out by the three high matriarchs, who are the sovereign leaders of the Nora tribe. Aloy completes the trial, and asks Teersa, a matriarch that who her mother was. Teersa tells her that they found her in front of the metal door, and she is believed to be the daugther of the goddess. Aloy quickly discovers that the door is just a door, and there is nothing to worship in it, and she tries to enter the room behind, but the door fails identification, so Aloy decides to embark on a journey to restore the door's memory, and gain knowledge both about her and the Earth's past and origins.</p>
            <p>During her quest she is aided by a mysterious stranger named Sylens, who seems to have a vast amount of knowledge about the Old Ones' world. Aloy also becomes the target of multiple assassination attempts, which were being carried out because she was looking similar to an unknown other woman. She discovers that she has near-identical genetics with the unknown woman, and she is able to exploit that by bypassing DNA scanners, and entering ancient facilities others couldn't before. This ability helps her research to progress, while the mysterious assassination attempts continue. She finds out that the unknown woman that she is the lookalike of, was in fact her genetic material, and she is a clone of her. A day, she discovers a facility which contains more data and material than the others, and she finally comes to full understanding of what has happened before. A corporation named "Faro Automated Solutions" have been developing and putting war machines into use to spare soldiers' lives, and enabling the robots to use biomatter as fuel. The robots experienced a glitch which made them disobey commands, so the company's head and Aloy's lookalike, scientist Elizabeth Sobeck, developed a project that was named "Zero Dawn" to make sure that humanity will survive the machine apocalypse. After learning the shocking truth, Aloy and Sylens' ultimate goal becomes discovering the way humanity survived the machine apocalypse back in the day in order to stop Helis, a tribal warlord who is a cultist, and is under the influence of a "god" called Hades. Later, Aloy reaches a secret underground bunker where holographic records on Zero Dawn are held. The project turns out to be a complex A.I. system called Gaia, a high tech Noah's arc secretly created during humanity's twilight to terraform Earth after the machines eradicate all life including humans and repopulate it again using genetic material stored in its cryostorage through bio-engineering and artificial insemination. In time, the system would also develop the necessary mechanisms to finally disable all rogue robots. However, a part of Gaia called Hades that was suppose to make sure that this new world was going in the right direction, or destroy it, if it doesn't, and let Gaia try again, began targeting humans once again for no apparent reason. Aloy is then caught by Helis, who reveals his plan to use the robots to conquer all other tribes and tries to execute her by dropping her in front of a machine that has been hacked and possessed by Hades, the rogue AI. She manages to defeat the machine and escapes with the help of Sylens who admits that he once belonged to the cultists himself. Aloy goes to rescue her people from the cultists' wrath and discover a way to either fix or destroy Hades. She eventually learns that one of Elizabeth's colleagues went mad and decided to kill the surviving members of her team as well as order Hades to destroy Gaia and make sure that the future humans will never learn of technology that destroyed their predecessors. She also learns from Gaia itself that she is a clone of Elizabeth, created to use her DNA to bypass the ancient facilities' security systems that hide the secrets of dormant Gaia and rebuild civilization. Finally, she learns that the only way to stop Hades is to purge its memory from the company's central bunker. Sylens finally comes clean and explains that he was the one who found Hades and helped it take control over Helis' tribe in order to learn about the past from it. After parting ways with Sylens, Aloy unites the tribes against Helis, repels his attack and defeats him. She then takes on the automated guardian of the central bunker and manages to shut Hades down. While the tribes celebrate, she ventures on into the uninhabited wastelands and finds Elizabeth's corpse along with an appropriately touching recorded message in which Elizabeth tells Gaia what she would have liked the daughter she never had to be like. After the end credits, Sylens is shown capturing the Hades AI in order to further uncover its secrets, namely, who was Hades' puppet master that turned it into a weapon of human extinction in the first place.</p>
