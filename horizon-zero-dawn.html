            <h2>Horizon Zero Dawn review</h2>
            <p>Review and summary on a story-driven computer game titled "Horizon: Zero Dawn", developed by the studio "Guerrilla Games", and published by Sony in 2017 for the PS4 Pro, later in 2020 for Windows 10. The narrative focuses on Aloy, the female protagonist who lives in the 31st century in a post-apocalyptic world, where humanity has fallen back into tribal culture, and practices a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.</p>
            <p>The game sticks to the classical RPG elements seen in other story-driven games, mainly to the ones that are published by Ubisoft. The well-known quest system is easy to understand, it operates with clear tasks, and gives enough crutches to enable newer players to enjoy the game just as experienced players would. The combat system is well-developed, extremely visual, and feels very rewarding. Taking down hostiles can be complicated, and depends on one's fine motor skills, as it is based on a rare "weak point" system. The graphics are stunning even on a weaker GTX card, thanks to the next-gen engine "Decima", developed by Guerrilla Games and Kojima Productions. The textures and shaders feel extremely crisp, but the poor anti-aliasing can often worsen the experience, especially on lower resolutions, and while the monitor panel is observed close-by.</p>
            <p>The story is absolutely worth the playthrough, you get approximately 25 hours on content, just by the main line, but further sidelines can be completed to lengthen the experience. The setting is a post-apocalyptic Earth, where nature has taken back its land, and humanity lives in tribal societies, surviving by hunting with spears and bows, and gathering food. They live among mechanical creatures, resembling various animal species, and they have no clue where they are produced, or why are they here. They have forgotten of the old civilization. One of the existing tribes, the Nora worship an ancient metal door, and an AI with a synthetic voice as their goddess, and one day they find a newborn baby on the the to the door. She gets cast out of the tribe, as she is motherless, and another outcast, Rost becomes her foster father. He names the baby Aloy, and teaches her the ways of survival in the wilds, and helps her prepare to win the Proving, which is a ritual of the Nora, it marks the start of adulthood for the participants, and if one finishing participant is an outcast, they can become part of the tribe once again. The winner of the Proving is granted a request, which will be carried out by the three high matriarchs, who are the sovereign leaders of the Nora tribe. Aloy completes the trial, and asks Teersa, a matriarch that who her mother was. Teersa tells her that they found her in front of the metal door, and she is believed to be the daugther of the goddess. Aloy quickly discovers that the door is just a door, and there is nothing to worship in it, and she tries to enter the room behind, but the door fails identification, so Aloy decides to embark on a journey to restore the door's memory, and gain knowledge both about her and the Earth's past and origins.</p>
            <p>During her quest she is aided by a mysterious stranger named Sylens, who seems to have a vast amount of knowledge about the Old Ones' world. Aloy also becomes the target of multiple assassination attempts, which were being carried out because she was looking similar to an unknown other woman. She discovers that she has near-identical genetics with the unknown woman, and she is able to exploit that by bypassing DNA scanners, and entering ancient facilities others couldn't before.</p>
