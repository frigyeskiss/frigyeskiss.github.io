            <h2>The history of basketball</h2>
            <p>Basketball's history started with the need for a sport like football, but less probability of injuries. Unlike football, this sport only dates back about thirteen decades, as it was derived from the idea of a canadian physical educator James Naismith in the United States around 1891. Naismith divided his group of boys, and instructed them to score goals by throwing a ball into baskets suspended from the balcony on the two shorter edges of the gym. A year later the first public basketball game was held, this time they referenced to the new game as "basketball". A player suggested the name "Naismith Game" after the inventor, but Naismith responded with the sentence "We have a ball and a basket: why donâ€™t we call it basketball?"</p>
            <p>In 1893, basketball started spreading through the world, and the first European match was arranged and held in Paris. In 1906, due to the spreading of basketball, metal hoops were introduced, and the previous need to retrieve the ball from the basked was bypassed. In 1914, as the WWI broke out, the United States' troops brought basketball with them through countries, and introduced it to even more people. In the 1920s multiple professional leagues were founded all across the world with teams making contracts. In 1939 the first ever "World Professional Basketball Tournament" was held.</p>
            <p>The first official basketball organization was founded in 1932 by a few European countries under the name of FIBA, which is the abbreviation of the French phrase for "International Basketball Federation". FIBA helped basketball to become the part of the Olympics in Berlin, in 1936.</p>
            <p>In 1946 the NBA, the National Basketball Association [of America] was founded, and since then it has been the leading basketball league in terms of sales and popularity. By the 1950s the NBA's roster was composed of african-americans in a great percentage, and since then, the race is commonly associated with basketball.</p>
            <p>Today NBA is still the biggest basketball league with leading popularity. In the 1990s the legendary player Michael Jordan helped to further popularize and spread the sport.</p>
            <p>Women's basketball was first officially played at the Southern Athletic Club 1895, but the first World Championship for Women was only held in 1953.</p>
