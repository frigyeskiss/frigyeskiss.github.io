            <h2>The history of golf</h2>
            <p>The famously Scottish game of golf is a "wee bit" older than people would think. There is no recorded date for the first golf game, but it's sure that the first golf-<b>like</b> they have ever written about was played not in "Sco'land", but in The Holland, in 1297, where the Dutch played a game with a ball and the stick where the objecive was to hit the ball into a hole with the fewest strokes possible. In 1261, the word "colf / kolf" was mentioned in association with the game in a Dutch text, where the word meant "club", which referred to the stick that was involved in the game.</p>
            <p>By any efforts of the Dutch imposters, the fact couldn't be changed that the modern, 18-hole golf has clearly originated in Scotland, where the word "gowf" was used to refer to the game, similarly to Dutch, with the two words having the same meaning. Ironically the first Scottish mention of the game was in an edict by the current king in 1457, which banned golf along football, as they were distractions from military archers from practicing archery.</p>
