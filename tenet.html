            <h2>Tenet review</h2>
            <p>I watch a lot of movies, and I like science fiction, but I have never came across such a mind-bending masterpiece as Christopher Nolan's <i>Tenet</i>! I have never been a fan of time-travel movies, but this one gives a whole new meaning to the word, and the concept of it is so confusing that one has to watch the movie multiple times to fully understand what's going on.</p>
            <p>The movie manages characters and settings similarly to others, but the cinematography gives an unseen charm to each scene, and makes the viewer focus on the surroundings rather than the plot, which further escalates the number of rewatches you need to understand the movie. It's sometimes hard to identify with characters, but it's acceptable due to how weird everything is, and the movie revolves around a CIA operative anyways.</p>
            <p class="alert alert-danger">HEAVY spoilers from now on, but this explanation might help you in understanding the movie.</p>
            <p>Here's a plot summary. A CIA agent is deployed in Kyiv at the National Opera House to extract a person before a terrorist attack. They get in a fight, but he is temporarily saved by an unknown soldier, who <i>"un-fires"</i> a bullet through his attacker's shoulder. He seizes an artifact, however, some mercenaries capture The Protagonist, torture him, but he consumes a cyanide pill to commit suicide. He later wakes up in a hospital room, and his boss reveals that the pill was a test, and in fact it did not contain cyanide. He is recruited from the CIA to another organization named Tenet, and after his recovery, the Protagonist is taken to a facility where a scientist shows him weird objects, which act like they were flowing backwards through time. The scientist reveals that the objects are from the future, and they might be the remnants of an upcoming World War, where their entropy has been reversed, and they are now travelling through time, just backwards. The Protagonist tracks down the origin of the bullets to Priya Singh, an Indian arms dealer in Mumbai, and he infiltrates her home with the help of Neil, another Tenet operative. Priya reveals that she is in fact a member of Tenet. And the bullets were distributed by a Russian oligarch, Andrei Sator. The Protagonist travels to London, where he manages to meet up with Kat, Andrei's estranged wife, who is controlled by his husband via a forged Goya painting which has been falsely authenticated by Kat. The Protagonist and Neil plan to steal the painting which is stored in a freeport in a free economic zone at the airport of Oslo. They make a plan which consist of driving a plane into the freeport warehouse while they infiltrate the building and use the chaos to seize the chance and steal the painting. They execute the plan, but they are attacked by two masked men, who seemingly emerge from a weird turnstile, and the one that attacks the Protagonist appears to move backwards through time. He manages to fend off the attacker, and Neil tells him that he has taken care of the other. The Protagonist meets Priya again, who explains that the turnstile was a machine which inverts the entropy of the material that is placed in it, and the two attackers were the same person, just traveling through time in two different directions, this is why Protagonist's attacker moved so weird during the fight. Kat and the Protagonist travel to Italy where he is introduced to Sator, who wants to kill him, but instead finds an unexpected ally in him. The two men plan to retrieve a stolen case that is said to contain plutonium-251, and Protagonist ambushes a convoy with Neil in Talinn, the capital of Estonia. The case appears to contain the artifact that has been lost in the Kyiv, and shortly after they are ambushed by an inverted Andrei Sator who holds Kat hostage. The Protagonist gives him the empty case, and tries to save Kat, but he is captured and taken to a building with another turnstile. The inverted Sator shoots Kat in the abdomen with an inverted round, while his non-inverted self asks The Protagonist for the location of the demanded artifact. The building is stormed by a Tenet group led by Ives and Wheeler, but they fail to capture Sator as he escapes into the turnstile. Kat's wound appears to be fatal, but the group uses the turnstile to reverse Kat's wound. As the Protagonist is inverted, he starts to see the previous events unfolding backwards. He gets in a car and travels to the ambush site where he fails to retrieve the lost artifact, and is almost killed by the explosion of his car that Sator ignited. He is knocked out, but Neil saves him, and reveals that he almost died of hypothermia as thh explosion's heat was inverted. Neil, the Protagonist and Kat hide in a container that is being transported to Oslo, and they arrive at the airport at the day of their earlier ambush to reverse themselves at the turnstile. An engine explosion blows the Protagonist into the building where he fights his past self, and understands that he was the two masked men that they fought at the turnstile. He inverts himself, and runs from the past Neil, but his mask is taken off, and the surprised Neil lets him to after he understands that this Protagonist is from the future. He meets Priya once again, who explains that the artifact was the part of an algorithm that Sator is trying to assemble, which would invert the entropy of the Earth, helping the future, but obliterating the present. He also learns that Sator is dying due to pancreatic cancer, and he is using a dead-man's switch which would trigger the algorithm, "taking the world with him". Kat figures that Sator will travel back in time to their vacation in Vietnam where he was last happy, and he plans to commit suicide to make the world die with his happiness. The trio travels back to that day where Kat disguises her as her past self with the intention of keeping Sator from dying until the algorithm is taken apart. Tenet tracks down the algorithm back to a Soviet ghost town in Siberia, and they launch a pincer movement, not in space, but time. Non-inverted red troops make an assault led by the Protagonist and Ives, while the blue troops split from them an hour later, to travel back to an hour earlier backwards, while the red team travel to an hour later forwards. Ives and Protagonist enter an underground facility, but a trap explodes trapping them inside. Neil, who is in the inverted blue team sees the explosion, and inverts himself to warn Ives, but he is late. Ives and Protagonist arrive at the location of the algorithm but they cannot get through some bars, and watch the algorithm being activated, helplessly. The soldier who is activating the algorithm is instructed to headshot the Protagonist, but an unknown soldier gets up from the ground inverted, takes the bullet instead of Protagonist, and opens the bars to enable the duo to steal the algorithm. Kat in Vietnam kills Sator prematurely, but she gets lucky as the algorithm is disabled by that point, and Sator's dead-man's switch cannot activate it. An explosion is about to go off, but Neil saves them by pulling them out to the surface with a car, and they split the algorithm in three to hide it in different places, then commit suicide to take the secret to their grave. Ives walks off while Neil gives his part to the Protagonist as he reveals that he was the inverted soldier underground who took the bullet, and now he goes to invert himself to do that. (This is hard to understand, and even harder to explain.) It is also revealed that he was the soldier at the Kyiv Opera who saved the Protagonist, and Neil was in fact recruited by the Protagonist, but in a different time, and this is the end of a friendship for him, but the Protagonist is only halfway through, as he is the one that found Tenet, just in a different time. Priya tries to assassinate Kat, but she is killed by the Protagonist.</p>
            <p>The easiest way to understand the movie is to make a table with events, and their date, and draw a line for each character in the order they move through time. I have done a graph like this, and I finally understood that the Kyiv Opera siege and the last battle with the inverted teams take place in one single day, which makes the whole movie a palindrome, with the latest events happening around the half of the movie.</p>
            <p>The scientific accuracy of course isn't perfect, but there are a lot of things that actually make sense. John Wheeler (who is the namesake of Captain Wheeler in the movie) made a theory that could be the base of the movie. It theorizes that electrons and positrons are the same entity, just moving in two different directions in time. Furthermore he says that every single electron in the universe is one single electron, just in different times of itself. All of the existing electrons can be put on a single timeline of one electron which travels forward, backwards then forward again through time. Time reversibility has also been theorized multiple times with the help of dynamic equations. If an equation is the same forward and backwards, and can be mirrored without a change in its truth. Multiple people have tried to reverse-engineer quantum mechanics too, but they could only work in reverse time if the reverse-operator would also reverse particle charges and parity coordinates, which would flip the world. In an interview Christopher Nolan stated that the film was based on real theories, but "weâ€™re not going to make any case for this being scientifically accurate".</p>
