            <h2>The history of golf</h2>
            <p>The famously Scottish game of golf is a "wee bit" older than people would think. There is no recorded date for the first golf game, but it's sure that the first golf-<i>like</i> game they have ever written about was played not in "Sco'land", but in The Holland, in 1297, where the Dutch played a game with a ball and the stick where the objecive was to hit the ball into a hole with the fewest strokes possible. In 1261, the word "colf / kolf" was mentioned in association with the game in a Dutch text, where the word meant "club", which referred to the stick that was involved in the game.</p>
            <p>By any efforts of the Dutch imposters, the fact couldn't be changed that the modern, 18-hole golf has clearly originated in Scotland, where the word "gowf" was used to refer to the game, similarly to Dutch, with the two words having the same meaning. Ironically the first Scottish mention of the game was in an edict by the king in 1457, which has banned golf along football, as they were distractions from military archers from practicing archery.</p>
            <p>The first text where instructions for golf were told was written in 1687 by a medical student who often played golf. He described a golf stroke like this:</p>
            <i>"I found that the only way of playing at the Golve is to stand as you do at fenceing with the small sword bending your legs a little and holding the muscles of your legs and back and armes exceeding bent or fixt or stiffe and not at all slackning them in the time you are bringing down the stroak (which you readily doe)"</i>
            <p>A text where rules were written dates back to 1744 and is in relation with the "Company of Gentlemen Golfers". The text was titled "Articles and Laws in Playing at Golf", and was also known as "Leith Rules", named after Leith Links, the field they primarily played at. Same year, a competition was held where the prize was a silver golf club.</p>
            <p>Golf started to spread beyond Scotland's borders in the <b>late 19th century</b> due to the fact that Queen Victoria made tourism possible by building railways between England and Scotland for quick and reliable travel. Tourists were interested in the history of Scotland. By 1890, golf was already widespread in England with a lot of courses and clubs, and kept spreading through the empire. </p>
            <p>Today, golf is classified as an upper-class game and is commonly associated with English nobles and Scottish people.</p>
