            <h2>Transport in Budapest</h2>
            <p class="alert alert-danger">DISCLAIMER: This article was made for a school project, it shouldn't be taken seriously, its sole purpose is the demonstration of the English vocabulary on transportation.</p>
            <p>The quality of transport in Budapest differs street by street, and by the time of the day. You may get stuck in a traffic jam for hours at 4.30 pm on Margaret Boulevard, but with a little luck you can make it home in thirty minutes, if you take an alternative route an hour earlier.</p>
            <p>Public transport is relatively fast and good compared to the capitals of neighboring countries, but the vehicles are dirty, uncomfortable, and they often have a bad aura. While BKK does a decent job at keeping their trams on time, a lot of other trains that travel between Budapest and suburban areas can be delayed for multiple hours, and occasions like this are not even rare. There are certain districts that are inaccessible by tram or railway, and the bus rides are often bumpy and not comfy.</p>
            <p>People with electric or hybrid cars are sadly pretty rare compared to more advanced countries. A lot of people choose public transport instead though, which is more environmentally sustainable.</p>
            <p>The lack of the planned M0 highway is also concerning, people going from Bécsi way to Pomáz often drive through Budakalász, my home town, and our once empty roads are now full on mornings and afternoons. This also forces residents to cross the city, rather than going around it, and it only makes more heavy traffic on the already full streets of the downtown.</p>
