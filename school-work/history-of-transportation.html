            <h2>History of transportation</h2>
            <p class="alert alert-danger">DISCLAIMER: This article was made for a school project, it shouldn't be taken seriously.</p>
            <p>Humans, for most of their history, were unable to move large distances, quickly. Later, they found out how to utilize horses or other mounts, but imagine moving from Berlin to Seoul on a horse’s back! Cannot be done quickly, that’s for sure. Fortunately, our ancestors were creative enough to invent new ways of transporting themselves and their belongings from A to B.</p>
            <p>Today, most people travel by car, but this way of travel is fairly new, its history doesn’t even go back 200 years. The first object classified as an automobile was created around 1885. It was developed by Carl Benz, and it was a one-cylinder two-stroke unit. It looked more like a cart at the time, but it was a large enough success to enable Benz to pursue his goal of creating a lighter, stronger car. He was the one who implemented the double-pivot steering system, which won him a large advantage in creating better and cheaper cars.</p>
            <p>In 1908, Henry Ford introduced the Model T, probably the most famous historical automobile. It finally resembled today’s cars in the slightest! His goal was to make it cheap, durable, and easy to operate. Ford said “any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it’s black”. Although the one color, the model became very popular, partly because as Henry promised it, it was easy to operate.</p>
            <p>The form of transport that preceded cars by a century were trams. The first tram was introduced in the UK in 1804, and at the time it was horse-drawn. Steam-operated ones were only placed into work around 1877, then in 1929 electric trams were made available to the public. Steam engines were made quieter, and the machinery was made safer for street use. A major drawback was the lack of space, as the engines took up a lot of it, making them underpowered. They were later replaced by electric engined trams. The first of these operated in Berlin from 1881. Initially electricity was transported by the rails, the overhead wiring only being installed two years later, in 1883. Between 1880 and 1920 there were various attempts to use other fuel types such as gas, but these were quicky overshadowed by the more modern, and far superior electricity.</p>
            <p>A lot of people would be surprised by the fact that attempts at making trains were present in the ancient greek world too, notably around 600 BC. The tracks were used to transport ship bodies to the sea over a 6-8 km long section of ground. The “train” itself was pulled by people and animals, and even though it couldn’t be easily said that it was a train, it certainly showed how the greeks were before their time by centuries sometimes. From 1510 ro 1550, wooden wagonways were introduced. Mainly to transport ore to the surface from mines.</p>
            <p>In 1784, steam-powered locomotives were finally introduced, but they were only made affordable, and perfectly working in 1804. A British engineer built a fully working railway steam locomotive. In 1812, the first commercially successful train was made, and in the following years, a lot of inventors further developed the initial idea.</p>
            <p>It might be surprising, but bicycles weren’t around until around the time of trains. In 1817, a German baron invented a tool that would let him travel around without the use of horses. It slightly resembled today’s bicycles, but it had no pedal, and was propelled by pushing your feet on the ground. Later the well-known large-wheeled bicycles appeared, but the term itself – “bicycle” – didn’t appear until the 1860s!</p>
            <p>The first great change of travel environment happened around 4000 BCE. Humanity needed travel between landmasses, so they started developing vessels that floated on the water. The earliest notes of traveling by sea are from Egypt, where boats were used to transport obelisks through the Nile. These ships were often propelled by sails and oars. These two things remained the primary methods of shipping until the early 19th century, when steamboats appeared.</p>
            <p>People always travelled on the ground, but dreamt about flying in the sky! Prior to 1903, humanity had to rely on balloons and gliders to experience that feeling, but in that year, on the 17th of December Orville and Wilbur Wright broke the boundaries by flying 35-40 meters over the course of 12 seconds with a machine that was way heavier than air. On January 1, 1914, the first scheduled air service began.</p>
            <p>While all of these discoveries and inventions are great, nothing compares to the newest possibilities that rised in the last century’s second half: space travel. Humanity is getting ready for the next age, when we finally defy the limitations of our planet, and break free. The moon landing, and the Voyager program were nothing compared to the future’s image: an interplanetary civilization, which isn’t restricted by the resources of their planets!</p>
