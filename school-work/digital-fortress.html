            <h2>Digital Fortress review</h2>
            <p>Review and summary on a novel, titled “Digital Fortress”, written by the thriller and mystery novelist Dan Brown. The book follows Susan Fletcher and David Becker on two simultaneous storylines as they try to solve the mysteries and obstacles of this mind-boggling techno-triller novel.</p>
            <p>The keyphrase for this book is "unexpected twists". After a few hours of reading, only one thing is certain: there are no certain things. There are so much turns, so much newfound mysteries that multiple times I found myself unable to register that who went where, who did what, "what happened at all"?!?! The tension on David Becker's line is amazingly carried, you feel that his life hangs on an extremely thin rope the whole time. The reader's attention is grasped and held in place throughout the novel.</p>
            <p>I love the environments in the book. David Becker's line takes place in Seville, and the writer describes the beauty of it extremely good. Susan is in the headquarters of the National Security Agency through the whole story, but it appears just as diverse and colorful as Seville! The characters are just as complex as every human being, and it's easy to understand their motivations and intentions.</p>
            <p>Here's a bit of backstory on the characters! Susan Fletcher is the head cryptographer at the United States National Security Agency, and oversees the work of the TRANSLTR, a secret supercomputer which cracks encrypted messages of terrorists and criminals, and helps the work of law enforcement branches. Her principal is Commander Trevor Strathmore, the right-hand of the director, and the leader of the code-decrypting unit of the NSA. David Becker is a college professor and the fiancé of Susan.</p>
            <p class="alert alert-danger">Spoilers start here</p>
            <p>Susan Fletcher gets a call from Commander Strathmore on a non-working day that she is ordered in because of a problem with the TRANSLTR. Strathmore leads Susan into his office, and tells her that the TRANSLTR has been working on a code for more than ten hours. This surprises Susan, as the computer usualy cracks codes in the matter of minutes. Further investigation reveals that the code is called the "Digital Fortress", and it has been developed by Ensei Tankado, an ex-NSA programmer, who wants to put privacy over everything, and ultimately wants NSA to fail. If the NSA doesn't reveal TRANSLTR to the public, Tankado intends to auction the code's algorithm on his website and have his partner, "North Dakota", release it for free if he dies, essentially holding the NSA hostage. Strathmore reveals that Ensei has died in Seville, probably from a heart attack. He intends to keep the fact a secret, because if Ensei's partner finds out, he will upload the code. They are lead believe that Ensei has stored his code on his ring which has been stored by the police department of Seville. Strathmore sends David Becker to retrieve the ring, but it appears that Tankado has given it away. Becker starts to track the ring down, but every person passed it on to someone else, and everyone involved gets murdered by a mysterious deaf assassin, Hulohot.</p>
            <p class="alert alert-info">I won't discuss David's line in details to spare the heaviest spoilers, as the turns and mysteries are the greatest there.</p>
            <p>During the time Becker spends tracking down the ring, telephone calls between North Dakota and Tokugen Numataka reveal that North Dakota hired Hulohot to kill Tankado in order to access to the code on his ring. Tokugen Numataka is willing to buy the algorithm, as he is the chairman of one of the greatest Japanese companies, and wants to make some money with the encryption method. At the NSA, Susan finds evidence that makes her believe that Greg Hale, an other NSA employee is in fact, North Dakota. Phil Chartrukian, a technician at the NSA believes that the Digital Fortress is a virus, as he doesn't know about the TRANSLTR's struggle with the encrypted code. He starts an investigation, even though Strathmore asked him to not do so. To save the TRANSLTR he decides to shut it down but is murdered after being pushed off the catwalk in the subfloor of TRANSLTR by an unknown person. Since Hale and Strathmore were both on the level of Chartrukian, Susan thinks that Hale is the killer, but Hale claims that he saw Strathmore killing Chartrukian. Hale takes Susan as a hostage to prevent his arrest for murder. Later Hale's name is cleared, as Susan discovers that Ensei Tankado and North Dakota are the same person, and the Digital Fortress is in fact a virus, just as Phil Chartrukian suspected. Strathmore manages to kill Hale, and Susan discovers that Hulohot, the assassin was hired by Strathmore to track down the ring.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile David manages to find the ring, but Hulohot starts to chase him, and almost catches David in the end of the crazy hide-and-seek game throughout Seville. David makes Hulohot trip down a staircase breaking his neck. David is discovered by other NSA agents, but he thinks that they are hostile, and he is shot in the abdomen while trying to run away.</p>
            <p>In the last part of the novel, the events are told from Strathmore's perspective, and his true motives are revealed. By hiring Hulohot to kill Tankado, having Becker recover his ring and at the same time arranging for Hulohot to kill him, he would facilitate a romantic relationship with Fletcher, regaining his lost honor and enable him to unlock the Digital Fortress. By making phone calls to Numataka appearing as North Dakota, he thought he could partner with his corporation to make a Digital Fortress chip equipped with the NSA's backdoor, so they could spy on every computer equipped with the chips. However, Strathmore didn't know that Digital Fortress was actually a computer virus that would delete the NSA databank's firewall and allow anybody to look at governmental secrets. Because of the virus, the TRANSLTR overheats, and Strathmore commits suicide by standing next to it as it explodes. The virus eventually gets into the database, but soon Becker, who survived the shot figures out the password, and they're able to disarm the virus, and keep data safe. The NSA allows Becker to return to the United States, reuniting him with Fletcher.</p>
