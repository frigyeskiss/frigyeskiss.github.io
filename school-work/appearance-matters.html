            <h2>Why I think appearance matters</h2>
            <p>Regardless what people say, almost all of us judge by a person's appearance, and it is completely alright, since our interactions with another person are heavily based on first impressions.</p>
            <p>If someone doesn't take care of their appearance, others might just place them lower on their internal list of "important". If you wear jeans and a pink t-shirt at a place you should wear a suit, other people won't turn to you with questions, and will ignore you and put your opinion under others. It will be also obvious that you are low-effort, and don't take anything seriously. If someone looks at your clothing and sees a mess, they will immediately think that your workstyle is similar.</p>
            <p>Personal hygiene is even more important, since it doesn't only affects your work, but affects all human interactions. A person with bad hygiene gives off a negative vibe, and people will immediately assume worse and worse things, and this will affect the way they interact with you. If you see a homeless or dirty person, you assume that their mindset put them in this situation, and this will overwrite any temptation you had to talk with them.</p>
            <p>First impression is also important and is affected by appearance heavily. If you dress well if you meet a new person, they will assume that you pay attention to detail, and care about personal relations enough to dress well for a meeting with them.</p>
            <p>Clothing has two extremes like other things, which means that dressing extremely classy or weird also makes an impression, which isn't always positive. You might seem like you want attention or you require a lot, which also tells people not to interact with you, since it would take too much time for them to fit to your needs.</p>
            <p>We can also overgeneralize by someone's face. We tend to interact more with people we find attractive, and tend to not interact with not attractive or unhealthy-looking people. There are people with facial features that resemble a baby's face, which makes the observer associate them with childish traits: naive, weak, submissive, honest. The emotions we show can also make a first impression, for example a person who simes a lot at a first meeting might appear affiliative or dominant.</p>
