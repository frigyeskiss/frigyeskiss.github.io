            <h2>The history of cricket</h2>
            <p>Cricket is known as one of the most complicated "club-and-ball" game, but it's played by a lot of people nonetheless.</p>
            <p>Cricket was most likely derived from the idea of anglo-saxon or norman tribes who lived in the southern parts of today's England. The exact origin is still debated to this day, but the oldest possible mention of cricket was in 1300, where a text about games mentioned <i>creag</i>, which might have been an old English word for cricket, but this source is fairly unreliable.</p>
            <p>It is speculated that cricket have survived several generations as a children's game, which didn't interest adults. In the beginning of the 17th century, adults reportedly started playing cricket, but the first definite reference was a little bit earlier, in 1597. In 1597 a court case was ongoing about a piece of land, in which case a game titled <i>creckett</i> was mentioned. One of the involved people mentioned that he played creckett on the debated site fifty years earlier in his childhood, which means that the game was most likely present around 1550, and this year is universally accepted as the first definite mention of the game.</p>
            <p>In 1611 two adults were punished because they reportedly played creckett instead of going to the church on Sunday. After this date, multiple mentions were made of cricket until the mid-1600s, which indicates that around that time, cricket has finally became an adult's game.</p>
            <p>After the Civil War ended, the documentations of cricket became less and less until the restoration in 1660, from which date cricket has become even more popular.</p>
            <p>In the 17th century, English colonists brought cricket to North America, later to West India, and in the 18th century, to other parts of the world. Cricket became a way to identify with the colonies' mother country.</p>
            <p>In 1744, the first official rules were documented. Exactly a hundred years later, in 1844, the first international cricket game was held between the US and Canada. In 1909 the Imperial Cricket Conference (later the International Cricket Council) was founded in England. In the 21th century, global championships were already held, and cricket made it into its form today.</p>
