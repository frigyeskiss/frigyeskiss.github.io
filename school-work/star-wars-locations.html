            <h2>Where was Star Wars shot?</h2>
            <p>A space-opera spanning through dozens of planets needs a lot of different locations and biomes to shoot scenes in, and this is no different with Star Wars.</p>
            <p>In 1977 the first planet that people saw on screen was Tatooine, but it has been shot on different locations, namely Tunisia and the Death Valley in the US. This difference in locations helped to show that Tatooine has biomes as Earth, and the terrain changes according to where we are on the planet.</p>
            <p>In "The Empire Strikes Back" the characteristic Hoth planet's scenes were shot in Norway, at the Hardangerjøkulen glacier.</p>
            <p>The sixth episode's main setting, the Endor moon was filmed in California in Del Norte County. It's a fun fact that this forest is the supposed habitat of the cryptic animal Bigfoot. Peter Mayhew, the actor of Chewbacca was instructed not to wander too far in his suit, since hunters might mistake him for Bigfoot, and shoot him.</p>
            <p>In 1999 when the era of prequels started, Star Wars returned to Tunisia for filming Episode I. The scenes set on the Naboo planet were shot in Italy. In 2002 Episode II also used Italy for scenery, but some scenes were shot in Spain instead of Italy. Episode III saw the most diversity in settings, so the locations were a lot different too. Some scenes were shot in Italy, but Switzerland, China and Thailand were used too.</p>
            <p>In 2015, Episode VII's desert scenes were shot in the United Arab Emirates. Scenes in cold environment were filmed in Iceland at the Eyjafjallajökull glacier. The rest of the scenes were shot in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Episode VIII was mainly set in space, so it has seen more VFX than real locations, but the few scenes containing planetary surfaces were shot in Croatia and Bolivia. Episode IX returned to the United Kingdom and Ireland, just with a few scenes shot in Jordan.</p>
            <p>The anthology film Rogue One also had some United Kingdom scenes, but also ventured into Iceland, Jordan and the Maldives.</p>
            <p>It is weird to see how much diversity can be created just in one single country, for example the United Kingdom was the setting for more than five planets.</p>
